<h1>The Best Korean Dramas According to Hansi</h1>
<h2>My Top Kdramas of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Queen of tears</h3>
<p>I love this cause the FL in the drama is a strong, independant women and the ML is a caring, lovely all rounder. In fact he's perfect in almost everything. Of cause they make a cute couple together and love the way they overcome challenges and made it up to their happy ending. Actually love this.</p>

<h3>Welcome to Sumdulri</h3>
<p>Here also we have a strong, independant, work minded fl and a lovely and the best wheather forcaster ml. They had many external issues but they just overcome all that and make it up to a happy ending of their own.</p>

<h3>Lovely runner</h3>
<p>Of cause ml is sooooo lovely. Fl made me so mad at times cause of her stupid attempts of saving the ml. The way they never seperated even through time and space. Love is embeded to our soul, our brain can forget the memories but our heart knows it all.</p>
